## Project Description
This is a javascript game for rolling a Die. It allows two players at a time to play against each other. At first the players fill in their names to start the game. The first player rolls a die. If the die lands on number 1 they cannot continue playing, so prompting the second player to roll the die. If the second player does not roll number 1 they continue rolling the die until they roll number 1 which stops them from continuing to play. In addition any player can hold their current score, prompting the other player to play next. Whoever scores 100 points first, they emerge the winner.
